## Import

```html
<script src="https://PARTNER.sdk.STAGE.com/index.js"></script>
```

the SDK will be exposed as

```javascript
window.paytheory
```

## Usage

There are ten Card, four ACH, and two Cash components available to use for payments.

### Credit Card Component

These components will provide a full payment implementation.

[codesandbox credit card component example](https://codesandbox.io/s/combined-credit-card-components-example-yd2iui)

Credit Card Component provides a single form entry combining:

-   Credit Card Number Component
-   Credit Card Expiration Component
-   Credit Card CVV Component

You can use this component along with the Zip component to collect all the data needed for a payment.

-   Credit Card Zip Component

Credit Card Component requires a container for the credit card input:

```html
<form>
...
<div id="pay-theory-credit-card"></div>
<div id="pay-theory-credit-card-zip"></div>
...
</form>
```

Credit Card Component cannot be used in combination with:

-   Credit Card Number Component
-   Credit Card Expiration Component
-   Credit Card CVV Component

### Credit Card Number, Expiration and CVV Components

These components along with the Zip component will provide a full payment implementation.

[codesandbox credit card components example](https://codesandbox.io/s/credit-card-components-example-bp9vfy)

These components must be combined in a form to enable payment:

-   Credit Card Number Component
-   Credit Card CVV Component
-   Credit Card Expiration Component
-   Credit Card Zip Component

A container is required for each component:

```html
<form>
...
<div id="pay-theory-credit-card-number"></div>
<div id="pay-theory-credit-card-exp"></div>
<div id="pay-theory-credit-card-cvv"></div>
<div id="pay-theory-credit-card-zip"></div>
...
</form>
```

These components cannot be used in combination with:

-   Credit Card Component

### Credit Card Account Name & Address Components

[codesandbox credit card address fields example](https://codesandbox.io/s/credit-card-address-components-example-e0qrpe)

Five optional components are available to capture additional details about the card:

-   Credit Card Account Name Component
-   Credit Card Address Line 1 Component
-   Credit Card Address Line 2 Component
-   Credit Card City Component
-   Credit Card State Component

These entries can be placed wherever you prefer in relation to the other credit card component(s).

Include a container for each of the optional inputs you wish to use:

```html
<form>
...
<div id="pay-theory-credit-card-account-name"></div>
...
<div id="pay-theory-credit-card-address-1"></div>
<div id="pay-theory-credit-card-address-2"></div>
<div id="pay-theory-credit-card-city"></div>
<div id="pay-theory-credit-card-state"></div>
...
</form>
```

### ACH Account Number, Bank Code, Name, and Account Type Components

[codesandbox ACH fields example](https://codesandbox.io/s/ach-components-example-43dc2g)

These components will provide a full payment implementation.

These components must be combined in a form to enable ACH payment:

-   ACH Account Name Component
-   ACH Account Type Component
-   ACH Account Number Component
-   ACH Bank Code Component

A container is required for each component:

```html
<form>
...
<div id="pay-theory-ach-account-name"></div>
<div id="pay-theory-ach-account-number"></div>
<div id="pay-theory-ach-routing-number"></div>
<div id="pay-theory-ach-account-type"></div>
...
</form>
```
### Cash Name and Cash Contact Components

[codesandbox cash fields example](https://codesandbox.io/s/cash-components-example-szgvnv)

These components will provide all info needed to generate cash barcodes.

These components must be combined in a form to enable Cash payments:

-   Cash Name Component
-   Cash Contact Component

A container is required for each component:

```html
<form>
...
<div id="pay-theory-cash-name"></div>
<div id="pay-theory-cash-contact"></div>
...
</form>
```
## Card, ACH, or Cash components on the same page

To display Card, Cash and/or ACH on the same page make sure only one is visible at a time and the others are wrapped by a parent element whose CSS is set to ``` display:none ```

## Styling the fields

To style the input parent div simply provide your own CSS for the pay theory containers you create. This is best used to style the height, width, and border of the container.

*Individual pay-theory-credit-card-number containers should be at least 340px wide, pay-theory-credit-card combined input should be 400px*

```css
#pay-theory-credit-card-number,
#pay-theory-credit-card-exp,
#pay-theory-credit-card-cvv {
  height: 1.75em;
  border: solid 1px #ccc;
  border-radius: 5px;
  margin: 4px 0;
}
```

To style the input fields you can pass in a custom style object to the create function in our SDK. This allows you to style the text inside the inputs as well as the style of the radio buttons for the ACH account type.

- default: (Object) The way a text field look when it is not in state success or error.
- success: (Object) The way a text field look when it is valid. Only applies to fields that go through validation.
- error: (Object) The way a text field look when it is invalid. Only applies to fields that go through validation.
- radio: The way radio buttons look for the ACH account type
    - width: (Int) The width in pixels of the radio buttons
    - fill: (String) The color of the radio buttons
    - stroke: (String) The color of the radio buttons border
    - text: (Object) This style object will be used to style the labels for the radio buttons
- hidePlaceholder: (Boolean) that allows you to hide the placeholder text in the input fields


```javascript
const STYLES = {
    default: {
        color: 'black',
        fontSize: '14px'
    },
    success: {
        color: '#5cb85c',
        fontSize: '14px'
    },
    error: {
        color: '#d9534f',
        fontSize: '14px'
    },
    radio: {
          width: 18,
          fill: "blue",
          stroke: "grey",
          text: {
            fontSize: "18px",
            color: "grey"
          }
    },
    hidePlaceholder: false
}
```

## Payor Information
This data will be used to create a payor that is tied to a payment.

- first_name: (String) The first name of the payor
- last_name: (String) The last name of the payor
- email: (String) The email address of the payor
- phone: (String) The phone number of the payor
- personal_address: (Object) The address of the payor
  - line1: (String) The street address of the payor
  - line2: (String) The street address of the payor
  - city: (String) The city of the payor
  - region: (String) The region (state) of the payor
  - postal_code: (String) The postal code of the payor
  - country: (String) The country of the payor

```json
{
  "first_name": "Some",
  "last_name": "Body",
  "email": "somebody@paytheory.com",
  "phone": "3335554444",
  "personal_address": {
    "city": "Somewhere",
    "country": "USA",
    "region": "OH",
    "line1": "123 Street St",
    "line2": "Apartment 17",
    "postal_code": "12345"
  }
}
```

You can also optionally pass in a boolean to use the same info that is passed into the card address fields if you want to avoid collecting this information twice on a card transaction.

When you pass this boolean in as true the only other fields allowed to be passed in are the email and phone fields. It will error if you pass in any other fields.

```json
{
  "same_as_billing": true,
  "phone": "3335554444",
  "email": "somebody@paytheory.com"
}
```

## Payment Metadata  

To track payments with custom metadata simply add key value pairs to the payment metadata object. The values must be scalar types (strings, numbers, booleans).

```javascript
const PAYMENT_METADATA = {
  "studentId": "student_1859034",
  "courseId": "course_1859034",
};
```

## Session Metadata

To track PayTheory SDK Sessions feel free to pass an object into the create function when initializing the SDK. These can be used to track sessions that are initiated but have not completed a payment.

```javascript
const SESSION_METADATA = {
        "page_key": "card-payment",
        "user_id": "123456789"
      };
```

## Handle state with callbacks

Mount to create the credit card, ACH, and/or cash field(s) and establish callbacks:

```javascript

// API KEY is required
const API_KEY = 'your-api-key'

// optionally define custom styles for the input components text
const STYLES = {
    default: {
        color: 'black',
        fontSize: '14px'
    },
    radio: {
          fill: "blue",
          stroke: "grey",
          text: {
            color: "grey"
          }
    },
    hidePlaceholder: false
}

// optionally provide custom metadata to help track sessions
const SESSION_METADATA = {
  "page_key": "card-payment",
  "user_id": "123456789"
};

// create a place to store the SDK details
let myPayTheory

(async() => {
    /**
    * initialize the SDK (can also be called as a promise)
    *
    * if providing metadata but no styles, provide an empty object
    * as a placeholder
    **/

    myPayTheory = await window.paytheory.create(
        API_KEY,
        STYLES,
        SESSION_METADATA)

    // mount the hosted fields into the container
    myPayTheory.mount()

    // handle callbacks
    myPayTheory.readyObserver(ready => {
        /**
        * ready is a boolean indicator
        * fires when SDK is loaded and ready
        * this is where you would associate any listeners
        * to trigger initTransaction
        * or optionally confirmation
        **/
    })

    // only needed when REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION is true
    myPayTheory.tokenizeObserver(tokenized => {
        /**
        * results of the payment card or ACH tokenization
        * fires once when tokenization is completed
        * this is a good place to enable confirmation
        **/
    })

    // only needed when REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION is true
    myPayTheory.captureObserver(transactionResult => {
        /**
        * results of the transaction with confirmation
        * fires once when capture is completed
        **/
    })

    // only needed when REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION is false
    myPayTheory.transactedObserver(transactionResult => {
        /**
        * results of the transaction without confirmation
        * fires once when transaction is completed
        **/
    })

    myPayTheory.validObserver(valid => {
        /**
        * valid is a boolean indicator
        * fires every time the valid state of the hosted field changes
        * when valid is true is a good time to enable initTransaction
        **/
    })

    myPayTheory.errorObserver(error => {
        /**
        * error is false or a message
        * fires every time the error state/message changes
        **/
    })

    myPayTheory.cashObserver(cashResult => {
        /**
        * results of the cash barcode generation
        * fires once barcode is generated following initTransaction
        **/
    })
  
    myPayTheory.stateObserver(state => {
        /**
        * state is a object indicating the current state of the hosted fields
        * fires every time the state changes or a field is focused/blurred
        * Example of the state object is below.
        **/
    }
    )

})()

```

## Initiate the transaction

When ready submit the transaction using the saved card, ACH, or cash details:

```javascript

//Amount passed in is in cents
const AMOUNT = 1000

// optionally provide details about the payor
const PAYOR_INFO = {
  "first_name": "Some",
  "last_name": "Body",
  "email": "somebody@gmail.com",
  "phone": "3335554444",
  "personal_address": {
    "city": "Somewhere",
    "country": "USA",
    "region": "OH",
    "line1": "123 Street St",
    "line2": "Apartment 17",
    "postal_code": "12345"
  }
}

const FEE_MODE = window.paytheory.INTERCHANGE

// optionally provide custom metadata to help track payments
const PAYMENT_METADATA = {
  "pay-theory-account-code": "code-123456789",
  "pay-theory-reference": "field-trip",
  "payment-parameters-name": "expires-in-30-days"
};

// optional parameter to require confimation step for Card or ACH
const REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION = true

// Parameters that you will pass into the transact function. More details below.
const TRANSACTING_PARAMETERS = { 
        amount: AMOUNT, 
        payorInfo: PAYOR_INFO, // optional
        payorId: "pt_pay_XXXXXXXXX", // optional
        metadata: PAYMENT_METADATA, // optional 
        feeMode: FEE_MODE, // optional
        fee: 100, // optional
        confirmation: REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION, // optional 
        accountCode: "code-123456789", // optional 
        reference: "field-trip", // optional
        paymentParameters: "expires-in-30-days", // optional
        invoiceId: "pt_inv_XXXXXXXXX", // optional
        sendReceipt: true, // optional 
        receiptDescription: "School Technology Fees" // optional
        recurringId: "pt_rec_XXXXXXXXX", // optional
}

const TOKENIZE_PAYMENT_METHOD_PARAMETERS = {
  payorInfo: PAYOR_INFO, // optional
  payorId: "pt_pay_XXXXXXXXX", // optional
  metadata: PAYMENT_METADATA, // optional 
}

/**
 * create a listener that will trigger the payment process
 * if REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION is true
 * this step will only complete tokenization
 * otherwise tokenization and capture observers are bypassed
 **/
const clickListener = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
...
  /**
   * begin the transaction authorization by providing an amount
   * and optionally details about the buyer and a flag for confirmation
   * amount must be a positive integer or an error will be thrown
   * */
  myPayTheory.transact(TRANSACTING_PARAMETERS)
  
  /**
   * begin the tokenization process by providing details about the payor
   * or a payorId
   * */
  
  myPayTheory.tokenizePaymentMethod(TOKENIZE_PAYMENT_METHOD_PARAMETERS)
}

/**
 * optional
 * use the tokenObserver to handle confirmation step
 **/
myPayTheory.tokenizeObserver((card) => {
  const confirmation =  `Are you sure you want to make a payment on ${card.brand} card beginning with ${card.first_six}`
  if (confirm(confirmation)) {
    myPayTheory.confirm();
  } else {
    myPayTheory.cancel();
  }
});


/**
 * use the ready observer from above to apply listeners
 * provide your own component IDs
 **/
myPayTheory.readyObserver(ready => {
...
  document
          .getComponentById("initiate-payment-button-id")
          .addEventListener("click", clickListener)
...
})

```

Once the payment has ended in either success or failure the buyer should be
directed to a results page.

## Transact Parameters
These are the values that you can pass into the `transact` function to customize the payment.  
The only required key is `amount`.

* amount: (Int)
  * represents the amount to be charged in cents


* payorInfo: (Object)
  * see the PAYOR_INFO object above for details


* metadata: (Object)
  * see the PAYMENT_METADATA object above for details 


* feeMode: (String)
  * Defaults to `window.paytheory.INTERCHANGE`. If available to merchant and set to `window.paytheory.SERVICE_FEE` the fee will be added to the amount and charged to the payor. More details about the fee modes in your PayTheory Portal.

* fee: (Int)
  * Represents the fee to be charged in cents. 
  * If you are using `SERVICE_FEE` mode and want to skip the confirmation step, you must provide the fee amount. This will be validated to make sure it matches the fee amount that would be charged. If the fee amount does not match, an error will be thrown.

* confirmation: (Boolean)
  * Defaults to `false`. If set to `true` the payment will return a response to the tokenizeObserver before it needs to be confirmed. Required if using `SERVICE_FEE` fee mode. 


* accountCode: (String)
  * Code that can be used to track a payment or group of payments. Will be included in the transaction schema and in the PayTheory Portal.


* reference: (String)
  * Custom description assigned to a payment. Will be included in the transaction schema and in the PayTheory Portal.


* paymentParameters: (String)
  * The payment parameters to use for the payment.
  * For more information on payment parameters check out the [Payment Parameters](payment-parameters) documentation.


* payorId: (String)
  * The PayTheory payor ID to use for the payment. Allows for user to manage identities. 
  * This cannot be used if also using the `payorInfo` parameter.


* invoiceId: (String)
  * The PayTheory invoice ID to use for the payment. Allows for user to assign a payment to an invoice. 

* recurringId: (String)
  * The PayTheory recurring ID to use for the payment. Allows for user to assign a payment to a recurring payment.
  * If you pass in a recurring ID, the transactions amount must be an interval of the recurring payments amount per payment.

* sendReceipt: (Boolean)
  * Pass *true* to send a receipt to the payor. Must have an email address on the payorInfo object or pass in a payorId that has an email address tied to it. 


* receiptDescription: (String) 
  * Description to be included in the receipt. Defaults to "Payment from {merchant name}". 
  * For more info on receipts check out the [Receipts](email-receipts) documentation.

## Tokenize Payment Method Parameters
These are the values that you can pass into the `tokenizePaymentMethod` function to tokenize a card or bank account.

* payorInfo: (Object)
  * see the PAYOR_INFO object above for details
* metadata: (Object)
  * see the PAYMENT_METADATA object above for details
* payorId: (String)
  * The PayTheory payor ID to use for the payment. Allows for user to manage identities. 
  * This cannot be used if also using the `payorInfo` parameter.

## Tokenization response

When the confirm option of initTransaction is set to true, the payment card or ACH token details are returned in tokenizeObserver

*note that the service fee is included in amount*

```json
{
	"first_six": "XXXXXX",
	"brand": "XXXX",
	"receipt_number": "pt-dev-XXXXXX",
	"amount": 999,
	"service_fee": 195
}
```

## Completion response

Upon completion of authorization and capture, details similar to the following are returned:

*note that the service fee is included in amount*

```json
{
    "receipt_number":"pt-env-XXXXXX",
    "last_four": "XXXX",
    "brand": "XXXXXXXXX",
    "created_at":"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ssZ",
    "amount": 999,
    "service_fee": 195,
    "state":"SUCCEEDED",
    "metadata":{ "pay-theory-environment":"env","pt-number":"pt-env-XXXXXX", "YOUR_TAG_KEY": "YOUR_TAG_VALUE" },
    "payor_id": "pt-pay-XXXXX",
    "payment_method_id": "pt-pmt-XXXXX"
}
```

If a failure or decline occurs during the payment, the response will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "receipt_number":"pt-test-XXXXXX",
    "last_four":"XXXX",
    "brand":"VISA",
    "state":"FAILURE",
    "type":"some descriptive reason for the failure / decline"
}
```

## Cash response

While generating the Barcode it will use the geoloaction to return a map url for the users specific location. 
If this is the first time it has been requested the user will have the opportunity to accept or decline the request.  

Upon completion of generating the cash barcode you will have these details returned:

```json
{	
    "BarcodeUid":"XXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXX@partner",
    "Merchant":"XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX",
    "barcode":"12345678901234567890",
    "barcodeFee":"2.0",
    "barcodeUrl":"https://PARTNER.STAGE.ptbar.codes/XXXXXX",
    "mapUrl":"https://pay.vanilladirect.com/pages/locations"
}
```

It is recommended at a minimum to provide both the Barcode URL and Map URL as external links to the payee.  
They can also be embedded in an iFrame on the page or shared in some other method.

## Payment Method Token Response

After generating the Payment Method Token when calling `tokenizePaymentMethod` you will get a response like this back to the completion observer:

```json
{
  "payment_method_id":"ptl_pmt_D1oc12GgwIGRNBpbwK8Ft",
  "payor_id":"ptl_pay_D1ls15qbE5TeLQQzkAHrB",
  "last_four":"5454",
  "brand":"MASTERCARD",
  "metadata": {
    "meta_key":"meta_value"
  },
  "expiration":"0444",
  "payment_type":"card"
}
```

## State response

The state object will include an object with all the possible fields that can be used with the PayTheory SDK and consist of 3 pieces of information.
- isFocused: boolean indicating if the field is focused
- isDirty: boolean indicating if the field currently has text entered
- errorMessages: array of error messages if the field is invalid

*Note: If using the combined card field you will receive state updates for number, cvv, and exp separately*

```json
{
  "card-number": {
    "isDirty": false,
    "isFocused": false,
    "errorMessages": []
  },
  "card-cvv": ...,
  "card-exp": ...,
  "card-name": ...,
  "billing-line1": ...,
  "billing-line2": ...,
  "billing-city": ...,
  "billing-state": ...,
  "billing-zip": ...,
  "account-name": ...,
  "account-type": ...,
  "account-number": ...,
  "routing-number": ...,
  "cash-name": ...,
  "cash-contact": ...
}
```

This can be used to help if you want to display field specific error messages or style the fields based on the state.  
This can also be used to help if you are using the Card Billing fields to capture the payor info and want to ensure the fields are filled out.

## Error Types

The error handler will return a string indicating what happened in the SDK. The string should start with one of the following error types:

- **FIELD_ERROR**: Issue with fields on the DOM when mounting
- **NO_TOKEN**: There was an error fetching the auth token when initializing the SDK
- **NO_FIELDS**: There were no fields found when mounting
- **NOT_VALID**: The fields are not yet valid when trying to submit a transaction or tokenize
- **INVALID_PARAM**: Parameters used to transact or tokenize are not valid parameters
- **SESSION_EXPIRED**: The SDK session has expired and is unable to send messages to Pay Theory

Most errors will require the user to refresh the page and try again.

The exception to this is the NOT_VALID error which will require the user to change the data in the payment fields until you get a proper response to the valid observer and then you may try and transact or tokenize again.

## Polyfill and IE 11

To enable IE 11 support you must include the following in your HTML head:

```html
<head>
    <!--
        you can find the latest versions of these at the following links

```

## Deprecations

* The createPaymentFields initializing function has been replaced with create. The create function no longer requires a clientID to be passed and allows you to set a feeMode.

* The initTransaction function has been replaced with transact. The transact function allows you to pass in the metadata at the time of payment for more time to collect data before having to pass them.

* Custom PayTheory metadata such as accountCode, reference, email, emailDescription, and paymentParameters have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. They have been given their own dedicated key in the transact function parameters object.
