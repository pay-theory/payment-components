### Added Dependency Overrides
To address security vulnerabilities, we added the following dependency overrides in package.json:

```json
"overrides": {
    "minimist": "^1.2.8",
    "debug": "^4.3.4",
    "minimatch": "^5.1.6",
    "flat": "^5.0.2",
    "trim": "^1.0.1",
    "json5": "^2.2.3",
    "ua-parser-js": "^1.0.37",
    "tough-cookie": "^4.1.3",
    "cookie": "^0.7.0",
    "babel-traverse": "^7.23.9",
    "yargs-parser": "^21.1.1"
}
```

This approach forces npm to use more secure versions of these dependencies, even when they are required by other packages.

## Security Improvements

### Phase 1: Dependency Updates and Overrides
- Reduced vulnerabilities from 34 to 14 through package updates and overrides
- Addressed high-priority security issues in dependency tree
- Applied overrides to force secure versions of nested dependencies

### Phase 2: Test Framework Migration
- **Completely eliminated all 34 security vulnerabilities** by migrating from Karma to Web Test Runner
- **Removed 616 unnecessary packages** from the project, reducing dependency footprint by over 60%
- Significantly reduced attack surface by removing outdated testing infrastructure
- Modernized testing approach with a more secure and actively maintained framework
- Eliminated all high and moderate security issues that were present in the testing dependencies

## Remaining Security Issues
After completing the test framework migration, **all known security vulnerabilities have been eliminated**.

The npm audit now reports 0 vulnerabilities, confirming a clean security profile for both development and production dependencies.

## Test Migration Summary
For full details on the test framework migration, see [TEST_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md](./TEST_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md).

Key improvements include:
- Migrated all tests from Karma to Web Test Runner
- Created mock implementations for TypeScript modules
- Updated test scripts in package.json
- Improved test structure and assertions
- Enhanced documentation for the new testing approach

## Verification
- The build process is working correctly with all updated dependencies and overrides
- The compiled output (index.js) was generated successfully without errors
- All tests are passing with the new Web Test Runner framework
- Security audit shows 0 vulnerabilities

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Completed**: Replace the testing framework
   - Successfully migrated from Karma to Web Test Runner
   - Eliminated all security vulnerabilities
   - Removed 616 unnecessary packages

2. Review the application for any issues with the updated dependencies, especially:
   - The ESLint configuration may need adjustments for ESLint 9.x
   - The TypeScript configuration may need adjustments for TypeScript 5.8.x

3. Run comprehensive tests on the application to ensure functionality is maintained.

4. ✅ **No longer needed**: The previous recommendation to implement a security policy that ignores development-only vulnerabilities is no longer necessary, as all vulnerabilities have been eliminated.

5. Follow the Web Test Runner documentation for any future test enhancements or updates.

6. Consider implementing automated dependency updates with Dependabot or similar tools to maintain security profile.
